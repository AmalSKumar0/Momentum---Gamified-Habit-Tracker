# Momentum---Gamified-Habit-Tracker

**Momentum** is a web-based productivity application that turns your daily life into an RPG. It leverages gamification psychology to help users build consistent habits by rewarding completion with **Gold Coins** and penalizing missed tasks by reducing **Health Points (HP)**.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
* A local server environment (XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, or Docker).
* PHP 7.4 or higher.
* MySQL.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/habitquest.git](https://github.com/yourusername/habitquest.git)
    cd habitquest
    ```

2.  **Database Setup**
    * Open phpMyAdmin (or your preferred SQL tool).
    * Create a new database named `habit_tracker_db`.
    * Import the `database.sql` file located in the `root` directory (see Schema below if file is missing).

3.  **Configure Connection**
    * Open `config.php` (or `db.php`).
    * Update your database credentials:
    ```php
    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "root";

## 🎮 Game Logic

  * **Health (HP):** Starts at 100.
      * If a user marks a task as **"Didn't"**, HP decreases by **10**.
      * If HP reaches 0, the user "dies" (reset stats or loose levels).
  * **Gold:** Starts at 0.
      * If a user marks a task as **"Did"**, Gold increases by **50**.
      * Gold can be used to "buy" rewards or restore HP (Feature in progress).
